After committing and pushing this file to your repository:

1. Go to your repository **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Build and deployment** → **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
3. The site will be deployed at `https://<username>.github.io/student-foundation/`

The workflow:
- Triggers on pushes to the `main` branch
- Checks out code, sets up Node.js, and installs dependencies
- Builds the project (output goes to `dist/`)
- Deploys the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch automatically
